//write me a poem
A poem of love and beauty
That will never cease to be
A love that's strong and true
And will last eternally

A love that's ever growing
No matter what we go through
It's a bond that can't be broken
And will always stay true

A love that's so pure and perfect
It brings us joy and peace
It's a feeling so divinely blessed
That will never ever cease
